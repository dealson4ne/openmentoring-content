Our risk assessment and strategies for staying safe shouldn't just relate only to our 'digital lives' but should, of course, also include our personal, physical, organisational and emotional security.

Traditional notions of security would include ideas such as the protection of a state, region, building or information system from external attack
That is to say, having control over the storage, communication, use and access of our digital informations.

Some times we may want to share information publicly in order to stay safe: for example, you may share your location with your friends and support network via text message or a social network if you find yourself being followed.

Which measures you should take to keep yourself and your information safe will depend on your own risk analysis.
